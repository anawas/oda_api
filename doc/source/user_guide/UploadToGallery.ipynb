    "\n",
    "For the data product we wish to upload over the gallerty, a number of arguments can be passed: these are, for instance, the images we wish to visualize and/or the parameters used for its generation. A comprehensive list of these, with their relative explanation, can be found below. It is worth to mention that such list will grow as more functionalities will be added to the product gallery.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Period of observation\n",
    "An important parameter that characterize a data product is the **period of observation**: this is defined by a time interval in which it is performed, as there might be several pointing directions and multiple targets. The period of observation for the data product can be indicated in two different ways: by an id or directly specifying a time interval. More explanations will be provided in the list below.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The following parameters can be set:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **product_title**: title to assign to the product, in case this is not provided one is automatically built using the name of the source and the type of product\n",
    "* **product_id**: identifier of a data product assigned by the user, this can be used during the creation of a new data-product, as well as to identify an already existing one and update it with the arguments provided by the user\n",
    "* **period of observation**: in the gallery, for each data product a period of observation can be assigned in two different ways:\n",
    " * **observation_id**: by specifying the id of an already present observation (eg 'test observation')\n",
    " * **T1** and **T2**: by specifying the time range, in particular the value of `T1` and `T2` in the following ISOT format `'2003-03-15T23:27:40.0'`\n",
    "* **produced_by**: direct link to the notebook used to generated the product\n",
    "* **gallery_image_path**: path of the generated image and to be uploaded over the gallery\n",
    "* **fits_file_path**: a list of fits file links used for the generation of the product to upload over the gallery\n",
    "* **token**: user token\n",
    "* **insert_new_source**: a boolean value to specify if, in case the sources that are passed as parameters and are not available on the product gallery, will be created and then used for the new data product\n",
    "* **validate_source**: a boolean value to specify if, in case the sources that are passed as parameters will be validated against an online service. In case the validation fails the source won't be inserted as a parameter for the data product and a warning for the user will be generated (unless this is intentionally specified setting to `True` the boolean parameter **force_insert_not_valid_new_source** described below)\n",
    "* **force_insert_not_valid_new_source**: a boolean value to specify if, in case the sources that are passed as parameters and its validation fails, those should be in any case provided as a parameter for the data product\n",
    "* **apply_fields_source_resolution**: a boolean value to specify if, in case only a single source is passed within the parameters and then successfully validated, to apply the parameters values returned from the validation (an example of these parameters are RA and DEC)\n",
    "* **html_image**: field used to upload an image encapsulated within an html block generated using external tools (e.g. bokeh)\n",
    "* **kwargs**: keyword arguments representing the parameters values used to generate the product. Amongst them it is important to mention the following\n",
    " * **instrument**: name of the instrument used for the generated product (e.g. isgri, jemx1)\n",
    " * **product_type**: type of product generated (e.g. isgri_lc, jemx_image)\n",
    " * **src_names**: name of a single, or a list of, known sources (eg Crab, Cyg X-1)\n",
    " * **others**: other parameters used for the product (e.g. RA=25). Not all the parameters are currently supported, but the list of the supported ones will be extended"
